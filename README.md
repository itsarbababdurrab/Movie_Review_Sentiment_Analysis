# Movie_Review_Sentiment_Analysis
This project implements a sentiment analysis model using the IMDb dataset. It preprocesses text by lowercasing, tokenizing, and removing stopwords. A logistic regression model is trained with TF-IDF features and evaluated using accuracy and F1-score. It also includes an interactive interface for real-time sentiment prediction.
